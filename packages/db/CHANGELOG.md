## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e24160b: Fewer stages, and when and where from (PLAN M5, step 3): Por clasificar folds into Nuevo and En conversación into
  "En contacto"; "Llegó el" on each person (unknown allowed, never in the future), with "Sin asignar" only for arrivals of
  the last 30 days; a day for attempts, notes and stage changes that happened another day; "Llegó por", from a list
  admins edit in Ajustes (the bot says WhatsApp, Global's form itself); a Discord username as a contact detail; the old
  "Llegó por" label on sources is now "Entró por"; the Panel counts arrivals by when and where from.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 6d930b7: M2 census schema: skills and areas to help in, edited in settings; a person's options; consents as a history with the
  wording's version; personal links; the census form's two functions for the public role; census answers in the
  Bandeja; erasure by anonymisation.
- 613d8ea: M0 foundations: database roles, staff, invitations, audit log and Better Auth's schema; Spanish messages; error
  tracking's privacy options.
- 1c5bd11: Arrivals without a name (PLAN R37): most bot reports carry only a phone number, so the bot saves a phone or an email
  alone in one step, without asking for a name, and quick-add needs a phone or an email but not a name. Such a person
  shows as "Sin nombre" in the bot, the team group and the staff app, is greeted without a name in WhatsApp, and gets a
  name from a later report, the census, a merge or their page; a name, once known, is never emptied.
- 8b141b4: M1 onboarding schema: people, identities, sources, community presence and the timeline; intake records and one
  matcher for every source; the Bandeja; merging; claiming and leaves; the attention rules; the bot's narrow functions;
  the Airtable sync's one function. Domain: contact normalisation, stages, attention reasons, and reading what the bot is
  told.
- e38e0f2: M3 outreach schema: organisations, contacts (tier, relationship stage, reason and sources, or to review; hold; a
  verified treatment only), campaigns with versioned templates per tier and sourced anchors, targets with the outreach
  CLI's statuses (never made ready or sent while their contact needs review or is held), an append-only timeline, and
  a contact's erasure. The letter renderer ported from the outreach CLI: merge fields that fail rather than blank, the
  neutral greeting, the dash and filler checks, the send order, and a mailto: link.
- f4a9480: The Telegram bot (M1): linking staff accounts from the staff app, the webhook, /alta, /baja, /mios, /libres,
  /buscar, /sincronizar, /ayuda and /cancelar, contact details deleted from the chat once saved, the team group's posts
  and claims, the daily digest and the dialog clean-up jobs, and the owner's telegram-webhook command.

### Patch Changes

- a5b0903: A campaign target starts in the queue: only an admin (the importer) adds one already written to, replied or met.
