## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- 2829bb3: The WhatsApp group's history comes in through Importar (PLAN R56): `pnpm whatsapp:csv`, run on the laptop that holds
  the group's export, turns it and the exporter's Google Contacts into a CSV with a row per stay in the group. The CSV
  import reads "Entró el" and "Salió el" and Baja, and saves someone known only by a phone, an email or a Discord
  username; the database records each stay once, closes it when a later export says it ended, and never reopens it.
  Joins and leaves go into a person's history on their own day. People who left come in too, as Baja (D16).

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- c875740: Organisations' old notes column is dropped: each one's notes became the first note of its timeline (PLAN R50).

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 43e95f1: Outreach contacts, organisations and notes can be kept "Solo yo": nobody else sees them, admins neither. Sharing one
  makes it the team's for good, and a contact the team already has (an email or the phone in common) is offered to
  merge into. Campaigns write to team contacts only. In Contactos, admins answer a rights request across private
  contacts too (download or erase); in Equipo, they hand a departed member's private records to someone in outreach,
  seeing how many, never what (PLAN M5, step 6).

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 5006e55: Admins set Global's Airtable view link in Ajustes, and turn the sync on or off there, instead of a sealed secret in
  gitops (ADR-0005, PLAN R49). The API stores the link encrypted with the deployment's `AIRTABLE_LINK_KEY` (a key sealed
  once by `scripts/seal-airtable-key.sh`, which never reaches the database) and never shows it again: Ajustes says who
  set it and when, and how the last run went. The sync, hourly or on demand, reads it only while it's on; off, or
  without a link, it does nothing. Importar shows the sync as off until an admin turns it on. The chart's
  `airtableSync.sharedViewUrlSecret` is now `airtableSync.linkKeySecret`, and `AIRTABLE_SHARED_VIEW_URL` is no longer
  read. The forms app only changes because the repository's root did.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- d00c2c0: Mensajes: the onboarding team writes the WhatsApp messages newcomers receive (the welcome and the census link's) in
  the staff app instead of in code. Several per purpose, picked when WhatsApp is opened; `{nombre}`, `{yo}` and
  `{enlace}` as placeholders, anything else refused as it's typed and by the database; a version for someone without a
  name; a preview. Each change is a new version, and the contact attempt and the census link name the message and
  version that went out. The code's own census link message no longer says "onboarding".

### Patch Changes

- a3e2970: Every database connection runs without Postgres's JIT. The planner's estimate for the attention view passes
  `jit_above_cost` with a few hundred people, and compiling the plan took ~0.6 s of a ~0.65 s Hoy (and as much of the
  Onboarding Pipeline), on every load: the query itself runs in ~20 ms.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e24160b: Fewer stages, and when and where from (PLAN M5, step 3): Por clasificar folds into Nuevo and En conversación into
  "En contacto"; "Llegó el" on each person (unknown allowed, never in the future), with "Sin asignar" only for arrivals of
  the last 30 days; a day for attempts, notes and stage changes that happened another day; "Llegó por", from a list
  admins edit in Ajustes (the bot says WhatsApp, Global's form itself); a Discord username as a contact detail; the old
  "Llegó por" label on sources is now "Entró por"; the Panel counts arrivals by when and where from.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 6d930b7: M2 census schema: skills and areas to help in, edited in settings; a person's options; consents as a history with the
  wording's version; personal links; the census form's two functions for the public role; census answers in the
  Bandeja; erasure by anonymisation.
- 613d8ea: M0 foundations: database roles, staff, invitations, audit log and Better Auth's schema; Spanish messages; error
  tracking's privacy options.
- 1c5bd11: Arrivals without a name (PLAN R37): most bot reports carry only a phone number, so the bot saves a phone or an email
  alone in one step, without asking for a name, and quick-add needs a phone or an email but not a name. Such a person
  shows as "Sin nombre" in the bot, the team group and the staff app, is greeted without a name in WhatsApp, and gets a
  name from a later report, the census, a merge or their page; a name, once known, is never emptied.
- 8b141b4: M1 onboarding schema: people, identities, sources, community presence and the timeline; intake records and one
  matcher for every source; the Bandeja; merging; claiming and leaves; the attention rules; the bot's narrow functions;
  the Airtable sync's one function. Domain: contact normalisation, stages, attention reasons, and reading what the bot is
  told.
- e38e0f2: M3 outreach schema: organisations, contacts (tier, relationship stage, reason and sources, or to review; hold; a
  verified treatment only), campaigns with versioned templates per tier and sourced anchors, targets with the outreach
  CLI's statuses (never made ready or sent while their contact needs review or is held), an append-only timeline, and
  a contact's erasure. The letter renderer ported from the outreach CLI: merge fields that fail rather than blank, the
  neutral greeting, the dash and filler checks, the send order, and a mailto: link.
- f4a9480: The Telegram bot (M1): linking staff accounts from the staff app, the webhook, /alta, /baja, /mios, /libres,
  /buscar, /sincronizar, /ayuda and /cancelar, contact details deleted from the chat once saved, the team group's posts
  and claims, the daily digest and the dialog clean-up jobs, and the owner's telegram-webhook command.

### Patch Changes

- a5b0903: A campaign target starts in the queue: only an admin (the importer) adds one already written to, replied or met.
