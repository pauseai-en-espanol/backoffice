## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- a4a1e91: Contacto takes a phone, an email or a Discord username in one field and tells which from what is typed, with no
  "Tipo" to choose; each detail is one line with its icon and "Quitar" at the end. Fields side by side keep their boxes
  in line however long their labels, and "(opcional)" moved into the hints, so labels stay on one line.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 4e92c54: A contact attempt may be a video call: "Videollamada" in "Por dónde", after "Teléfono".

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 2829bb3: The WhatsApp group's history comes in through Importar (PLAN R56): `pnpm whatsapp:csv`, run on the laptop that holds
  the group's export, turns it and the exporter's Google Contacts into a CSV with a row per stay in the group. The CSV
  import reads "Entró el" and "Salió el" and Baja, and saves someone known only by a phone, an email or a Discord
  username; the database records each stay once, closes it when a later export says it ended, and never reopens it.
  Joins and leaves go into a person's history on their own day. People who left come in too, as Baja (D16).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 01e38c3: Cards say who someone is (PLAN M5, step 4): the name with the province ("Maite (Madrid)"), a one-line internal
  summary the team writes in the profile (never sent to Telegram), and what is missing in plain words ("Falta: correo ·
  qué quiere hacer"), on Hoy, Personas, the Onboarding Pipeline, the Bandeja, Censo and the person's page.
- d00c2c0: Mensajes: the onboarding team writes the WhatsApp messages newcomers receive (the welcome and the census link's) in
  the staff app instead of in code. Several per purpose, picked when WhatsApp is opened; `{nombre}`, `{yo}` and
  `{enlace}` as placeholders, anything else refused as it's typed and by the database; a version for someone without a
  name; a preview. Each change is a new version, and the contact attempt and the census link name the message and
  version that went out. The code's own census link message no longer says "onboarding".

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e24160b: Fewer stages, and when and where from (PLAN M5, step 3): Por clasificar folds into Nuevo and En conversación into
  "En contacto"; "Llegó el" on each person (unknown allowed, never in the future), with "Sin asignar" only for arrivals of
  the last 30 days; a day for attempts, notes and stage changes that happened another day; "Llegó por", from a list
  admins edit in Ajustes (the bot says WhatsApp, Global's form itself); a Discord username as a contact detail; the old
  "Llegó por" label on sources is now "Entró por"; the Panel counts arrivals by when and where from.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 5879bda: The bot's commands in English with Spanish names that work the same (PLAN R38): `/joined` (`/alta`), `/left`
  (`/baja`), `/mine` (`/mios`), `/unassigned` (`/libres`), `/search` (`/buscar`), `/sync` (`/sincronizar`), `/help`
  (`/ayuda`), `/cancel` (`/cancelar`). The API sets Telegram's command menu on every start, by the Spanish names
  and, for English Telegram, by the English ones, described in Spanish; replies name a command by both names.
- 8b141b4: M1 onboarding schema: people, identities, sources, community presence and the timeline; intake records and one
  matcher for every source; the Bandeja; merging; claiming and leaves; the attention rules; the bot's narrow functions;
  the Airtable sync's one function. Domain: contact normalisation, stages, attention reasons, and reading what the bot is
  told.
- e38e0f2: M3 outreach schema: organisations, contacts (tier, relationship stage, reason and sources, or to review; hold; a
  verified treatment only), campaigns with versioned templates per tier and sourced anchors, targets with the outreach
  CLI's statuses (never made ready or sent while their contact needs review or is held), an append-only timeline, and
  a contact's erasure. The letter renderer ported from the outreach CLI: merge fields that fail rather than blank, the
  neutral greeting, the dash and filler checks, the send order, and a mailto: link.
